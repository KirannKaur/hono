# Connect. Command. Control.

Eclipse Hono&trade; provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a
back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol.

Hono specifically supports scalable and secure ingestion of large volumes of sensor data by means of
its Telemetry and Event APIs. Hono's Command &amp; Control API allows for sending commands
(request messages) to devices and receive a reply to such a command from a device in an asynchronous way.


Finally, Hono provides APIs for integration with existing device and credentials management systems.
